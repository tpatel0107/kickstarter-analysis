# Kickstarting with Excel

#Overview of the Project

## Overview of Project is to anlayze the kickstarter campaign to see how different campagins fared in relations to thier launch dates and funding goals. I looked at the Theater catergory to analzye outcomes vs the launch dates. I also analyzed the subcatergory of plays to see how funding goals faired against how successsful the plays were

#Purpose of Analysis

### Purpose to analyze the kickstarter campaign to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals to in order to establish how well the parent catergory theater achieved it's goals based on launch date. Also we analyzed the subcartegory of plays to see how well this performed in reaching it's goal. 

#Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis and Challenges lack of data for the canceled plays, this resulted in zeros for outcomes vs goals. However good amount of data was provided for theater outcomes by launch date (refer to attached snipit it for canceled plays)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date from this data we can summarize that majority of the theater category faired well and was widely successful throughout the years, there wasn't a significant amount of failures to report here (refer to attached snipits for outcomes vs launch date)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals from this data we can summarize that the sum of percentage successful was higher with the lower goal amounts, while the percentage of failure was higher with higher goal amount for the plays category(refer to snip it for failure vs goal amt)

#Challenges and Difficulties

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered I need more data on the plays subcatergory to see how the trend continues to get a better picture of outcomes vs goals (see graph for outcomes based on goal)

## Results

 Failures took  place at a steady rate throughout the year, however if more theater events were planned in the 2nd quarter there would a higher success rate

 If goal amount was smaller we acheived a higher success rate. This means keep the goals more reasonable to get a higher success rate in the future

 I would want more years analyzed in order to see proper trends

We could create Outcomes vs goals for the theater parent category to see how funding goal changed the outcomes. We could also create plays outcomes by launch date-to see how the plays faired over the years
